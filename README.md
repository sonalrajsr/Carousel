This is a simple Carousel project as that of Bootstrap, having six different images that one can scroll through by clicking the lift and right sign buttons.(\n)

This is based on simple animation of left and right scrolling, but the unique thing is when you click on the last image, it will show a very small zig-zag-like effect.
